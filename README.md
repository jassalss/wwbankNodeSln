# wwbank Canada Node.js App 

It is the Node.js + Firebase + Rest API project. This task is a reproduction of the financial procedure. I made six distinctive endpoints to mock the financial framework. User can create the bank account, deposit or withdraw the money. The user also can transfer money from one account to another account. There are some other features like checking the balance and checking all accounts.


For this app, MVC architecture is followed. Routes are in a different folder, and controllers are in a separate folder. For request and response, JSON is used.
There is no frontend for this app. I created an independent React app for frontend (Option B). Kindly test this app in Postman or other application. 
Most of the request methods are post. So it would be best if you had Postman.

For testing, Jest is used. All the test present in-app are passing. Test cases defined in challenge document are also passing. 
Please consider this sprit 1 of the project. More features can be added later on.
